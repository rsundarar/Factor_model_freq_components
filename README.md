# Factor_model_freq_components #

Preliminaries: Load the R libraries in lines 9-16 of the file factor_analysis_functions.R. 

The wrapper function to use is factor_analysis(). Function inputs a multivariate time series, discretized set of frequencies in the interval (0,0.5) and bandwidth. Function outputs factor dimension and factor series. 

Usage: Run the file simulation_example.R for an example simulation run.
